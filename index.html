          <p>I live and work in San Francisco, but raised in Brooklyn, NY. I love drawing in my sketchbook, calligraphy and hand-lettering, yoga, DIY projects, laughing with my friends, coding websites, and being outside. When I'm not learning new things or challenging myself, I feel uneasy. I am a risk taker. I am most happy in an environment where I can express my creativity and work with like minded people. My best ideas come from collaboration.</p>
           <p>I solve problems one pixel and one bracket at a time. Currently I’m the UX/Visual Designer at Upsight. I lead the user experience strategy at Upsight and design new product features from specs to wireframes to full mockups to code complete. I helped design and code the Upsight website. I also work on product marketing for print and web. Since Upsight merged and rebranded into a new company in Nov 2013, I helped rebrand Upsight, redesign our current dashboard/product, the new brand and UI style guides.  </p>

          <p>Before Upsight, I worked at OMGPOP. At OMGPOP, I helped design UI elements for DrawSomething, designed the marketing campaign for the game and worked on marketing ads for OMGPOP's other games. While at OMGPOP, I cofounded Matchpuppy, a website that makes scheduling playdates with your dog very easy. I was inspired by my dogs lack of social skills and my cofounder and I built the app. It was an interesting learning experience. We grew our user base to almost 10,000 users. When the site was not growing anymore, we realized there's a lot more out there for us to learn, so we stopped the project.</p>

          <p>Before Matchpuppy and OMGPOP, I got my first job that jumpstarted my career in design. I received a BS in Actuarial Science with a minor in Art History. My first job out of college was a risk analyst at a mid sized vision insurance firm in New York. I knew I wanted to design because I was always obsessed with HTML/CSS and drawing. From the age of 11, I was convinced that everyone needed a website. I made a geocities website for my mom, for my dad and for my dog.  </p>

          <p>I left my job pursuing actuarial science and enrolled in design classes at the School of Visual Arts in New York. My first design job was at 20th Street Media, a small design firm in New York City. I applied for a job there and begged them to hire me for no pay. I didn’t have any Photoshop/Illustrator skills...yet, so I came to the interview with my typography design projects that I worked on at SVA. It didn’t exemplify any computer design knowledge, but it showed that I had a knack for creativity. I got the job. Three months later and 400 hours of photoshop and illustrator tutorials later, I was hired fulltime. I worked on any website that came through the door. And with lots of practice I learned how to be a designer.</p>

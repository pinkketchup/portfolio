           <p>I solve problems one pixel and one bracket at a time. Currently I’m the UX/Visual Designer at Upsight. I lead the user experience strategy at Upsight and design new product features from specs to wireframes to full mockups. I helped design and code the Upsight website. I also work on the product marketing for print and web. Since Upsight merged and rebranded into a new company in Nov 2013, I helped rebrand Upsight, redesign our current dashboard/product, the new brand and UI style guides.  </p>

          <p>Before Upsight, I worked on my own startup, Matchpuppy while I worked at OMGPOP. At OMGPOP, I helped design UI elements for DrawSomething, designed the marketing campaign for the game and worked on marketing ads for other games, as well as, UI game elements. At Matchpuppy, I designed the website and web app for dog owners to meet other dog owners. I was inspired by my dogs lack of social skills and my cofounder and I built the startup. It was an interesting learning experience. We grew our user base to 10,000 users, we didn’t receive any funding, so we stopped the project. </p>

          <p>Before Matchpuppy and OMGPOP, I got my first job that jumpstarted my career in design. I didn’t have a portfolio or design background. I received a BS in Actuarial Science with a minor in Art History. My first job out of college was a risk analyst at a mid sized vision insurance firm in New York. I knew I wanted to design because I was always obsessed with HTML/CSS and drawing. From the age of 11, I was convinced that everyone needed a website. I made a geocities websites for my mom, for my dad and for my dog.  </p>

          <p>I left my job pursuing actuarial science and enrolled in design classes at the School of Visual Arts in New York. My first design job was at 20th Street Media, a small design firm in New York City. I applied for a job there and begged them to hire me for no pay. I didn’t have Photoshop/Illustrator knowledge, but I did have some typography design projects in my portfolio that I worked on at SVA. They didn’t exemplify any computer design knowledge, but it showed that I had a knack for creativity. I got the job. Three months later and 400 hours of photoshop and illustrator tutorials later, I was hired. I worked on any website that came through the door. </p>
